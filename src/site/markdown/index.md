#TMS: Transportation

The TMS Transportation allows to create Transport Orders in automated warehouses. A
Transport Order is used to transport pallets, boxes, cartons or other types of Transport
Units between Locations in a warehouse. Usually a couple of Transport Order are created
when a customer order is received or when a lorry of goods arrives at the warehouse.
 
This kind of Transport Orders are meant to be used in automated warehouses. Other concepts
with other transport types, like Movements, do better apply for manual warehouses.
